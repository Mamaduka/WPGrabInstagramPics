This plugin will search through recent Instagram posts (containing a certain hashtag or keyword), and import those photos along with some metadata into WP's media gallery.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the WPGrabInstagramPics folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Update a key term in the options, click the "grab" button in the grab area and watch the magic (look in your media area). My test hashtag is #confrz.
